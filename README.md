# ProjectNasospeech


NasoSpeech, a tangible and an interactive tool, is our response to the current state of art in the assessment of hypernasality of CLP patients. We aim to make it simple-to-use and user-friendly for both CLP patients and speech pathologists. It will be non-restrictive, mobile, fast and accurate with inbuilt state-of-the-art Speech processing methods. NasoSpeech will have the ability to support mediated scenarios of distant assessment, counselling and self-learning for CLP patients, and would enhance collaboration between CLP patients and speech pathologists.
